## Innovative Practices (Exceeds Best Practices)

### 1. Resume Capability via State File ⭐
- Explicitly designed for compaction resilience
- State file enables resumption after interruption
- **Goes beyond documented best practices** - addresses real-world long-running agent challenges
- Clear state schema with all necessary context

### 2. Context Preservation Architecture ⭐
- Main agent = lightweight orchestrator
- Subagents = fresh context for deep work
- Explicitly prevents main agent context bloat
- **Advanced pattern** not explicitly covered in best practices documentation

### 3. Design vs Plan Hierarchy ⭐
- "Design (WHY) is sacred, Plan (HOW) adapts"
- Empowers autonomous decision-making within constraints
- Clear decision framework for when to adapt
- Prevents paralysis from plan conflicts

### 4. Time Budget Management ⭐
- 6-hour default with explicit checking
- Prevents runaway resource consumption
- Graceful exit with reporting
- Practical constraint for production use

## Recommendations

### High Priority

#### 1. Add Model Testing Documentation
**Issue:** Best practice requires testing across Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. No evidence of cross-model testing in documentation.

**Fix:** Add to SKILL.md frontmatter or create `testing.md`:

```yaml
---
name: autonomous-execution
description: Execute implementation plans autonomously over extended periods...
tested_models:
  - claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  - claude-haiku-3-5-20250301
  - claude-opus-3-5-20250229
---
```

Or add section to SKILL.md:

```markdown
## Testing

This skill has been tested with:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (primary)
- Claude Haiku 3.5 (verified core workflows)
- Claude Opus 3.5 (verified complex decision-making)
```

**Impact:** Documentation completeness, user confidence

---

### Medium Priority

#### 2. Consider Task Brief Files for Subagent Prompts
**Issue:** Subagent prompts in YAML blocks are detailed but inline. Best practice: "verifiable intermediates" for complex tasks.

**Current:**
```yaml
prompt: |
  You are implementing Task N from [implementation-plan-path].

  Read that task carefully. Your job is to:
  1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
  2. Follow TDD as specified in the task
  ...
```

**Suggested enhancement:**
```yaml
prompt: |
  You are implementing Task N.

  Read your task brief: docs/tasks/task-N-brief.md

  This brief contains:
  - What to implement
  - Design context (WHY)
  - Prior decisions (from execution log)
  - Verification criteria

  Work autonomously. Report back concisely as specified in brief.
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces inline YAML prompt length
- Leverages "verifiable intermediates" pattern
- Brief file can include structured checklist
- Easier to review/audit task assignments

**Impact:** Code clarity, follows best practice pattern more closely

---

#### 3. Standardize Subagent Terminology
**Issue:** Minor terminology variation throughout skill.

**Current usage:**
- "implementation subagent"
- "fix subagent"
- "general-purpose subagent"
- "task subagent"

**Recommended standardization:**
- "task subagent" (for implementation work)
- "fix subagent" (for issue resolution)
- "general-purpose agent" (when referring to Task tool type)

**Changes needed:**
- Search/replace "implementation subagent" → "task subagent" throughout
- Ensure consistent usage in all sections

**Impact:** Minor consistency improvement, easier to read

---

### Low Priority

#### 4. Verify Reference File Structure
**Issue:** Best practice requires table of contents for files exceeding 100 lines.

**Action needed:** Check if these files need TOCs:
- `reference/state-file-format.md`
- `reference/execution-log-format.md`
- `reference/final-report-template.md`

**If any file >100 lines, add TOC:**
```markdown
# State File Format

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Schema](#schema)
- [Fields](#fields)
- [Examples](#examples)

## Overview
...
```

**Impact:** Improves navigation in long reference files

---

#### 5. Add Evaluation Examples
**Issue:** Best practice recommends "evaluation-driven approach" - create test scenarios before extensive documentation.

**Suggested addition:** Create `examples/` directory with:
- `example-state-file.json` (from successful run)
- `example-execution-log.md` (from successful run)
- `example-final-report.md` (from successful run)
- `example-adapted-plan.md` (showing plan evolution)

**Benefits:**
- Shows skill in action
- Provides templates users can reference
- Validates skill works as documented
- Supports evaluation-driven development

**Impact:** Better documentation, user confidence, validation
